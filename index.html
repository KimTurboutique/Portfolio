                <p> I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer. My interest in web development and coding started when I built a Shopify E-commerce store for my business. 
                    A business colleague suggested taking a coding bootcamp as he saw how enthused I was with building my store. 
                    I also wanted a new challenge in life as a dedicated individual that is always looking to gain skills and knowledge in multiple fields. 
                    After doing some research I decided to join the UM Coding Boot Camp where I am currently learning the fundamental skills needed to become a full-stack web developer. </p>
